##What did you build? 
I built a game that was inspired by Rick and Morty, the Hyper Realistic Space Game. It's basically like Astroid except with some features, i.e. realism, that adjust the number of astroids and make the game actually realistic (by taking the astroids away).

##What language(s) or tools did you use?
I mainly used HTML and just imbedded the code within the HTML file.

##Which AI tools did you use, and how? 
I mainly used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, the free edition. I would ChatGPT to sort of think of ideas, but most of the ideas that were coming out of ChatGPT were very boring and somewhat corny, so I decided to just try to make my game based off of something else, which is the game Rick and Morty. As for GitHub Copilot, I would use it to help fix some errors within my code or anything that I couldn't really get working, or know where to start.

##What did you do versus what AI helped with? 
I, of course, lay down the basic code, such as the restart game button. The typewriter effect was from a previous project, so basically just copy and paste the layboard movements, the evenlist for when you crash, the realism slider, and bullets, but AI had just aided not do the entire project. AI had helped me when I was trying to figure out how to make it so that the ship had an acceleration button/action key, and basically the rest that I hadn't included on the list above had some part of role.

##What’s one thing you’re proud of?
I am very proud of the movement of the ship within the game as well as how the realism function actually works.

##What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?
I think that if I was given more time, I would improve on the overall look of the website as well as try to see if I couldn't get it to make a somewhat decent 3D model of the game within the website without crashing or anything like that. But yeah, overall, I would just want to improve the overall look and feel of the website (if I had more time).
